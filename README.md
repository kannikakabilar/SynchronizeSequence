# SynchronizeSequence
The Synchronize Sequence program effectively utilizes the multiple cores of a device's processor to calculate high orders of a sequence synchronously. The program makes use of fork system call to run processes concurrently and share results through a pipe file descriptor. This program can be used to execute memory occupying and cpu bound processes simultaneously allowing to reduce the completion time. The program can also be easily modified adding execl() system call to execute another program synchronously to calculating the order of the sequence.
